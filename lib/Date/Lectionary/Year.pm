A helper object for Date::Lectionary to package which keeps information about the liturgical cycle year for the RCL, ACNA, and possibly other three-year lectionary systems.  Valid values for the liturgical cycle are A, B, or C.

enum 'litCycleYear', [qw(A B C)];
no Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=cut

has 'year' => (
  is				=> 'ro',
  isa				=> 'Int',
  required 	=> 1,
);

has 'name' => (
	is 				=> 'ro',
	isa 			=> 'litCycleYear',
	writer 		=> '_setName',
	init_arg	=> undef,
);

=head2 BUILD

Constructor for the Date::Lectionary::Year object.  Takes a four-digit representation of the Common Era year and returns the correct liturgical cycle year for the RCL, ACNA, and possibly other three-year lectionary systems.

=cut

sub BUILD {
	my $self = shift;

	$self->_setName(_determineYear($self->year));
}

=head2 _determineYear

Private method that takes a four-digit representation of the Common Era year and calculates the liturgical year -- A, B, or C -- for the year.

=cut

sub _determineYear {
	my $calYear = shift;

	try{
		if ($calYear%3 == 0) {
			return 'A';
		}
		elsif (($calYear-1)%3 == 0) {
			return 'B';
		}
		elsif (($calYear-2)%3 == 0) {
			return 'C';
		}
		else {
			confess "The liturgical year for the year [" . $calYear . "] could not be determined.";
		}
	}
	catch{
		confess "A liturgical year for the value [" . $calYear . "] could not be calculated.";
	}
}
